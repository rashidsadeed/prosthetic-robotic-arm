# prosthetic-robotic-arm
A robotic arm aimed at indivduals who have lost an arm, by birth or by accident. The arm works in unison with the persons abled arm, emulating its motion through flex sensors worn on the abled hand.
The sensors are conneted to an Arduino which translates the data recieved from the sensors into signals for the motors to move the prosthetic arm and the fingers.
